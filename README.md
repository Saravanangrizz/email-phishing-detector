🛡️ Phishing Email Detection Web App

A full-stack cybersecurity project that detects phishing emails using NLP-based machine learning, built with:

🔥 Flask (Python backend)

🧠 BERT (DistilBERT) embeddings for text understanding

🌐 React + Tailwind CSS frontend

🚀 Deployed using Render

🎯 Objective

Detect phishing emails based on their content and header details, and help users understand why an email is flagged as phishing using natural language processing and keyword analysis.

✅ Features

🔍 Email Detection (Backend)

->Uses BERT (DistilBERT) to convert email content into contextual embeddings

->Trained with a RandomForestClassifier to classify emails as:

->Phishing

->Legit

->Supports email header inputs (From, Reply-To) to analyze spoofing

->Handles imbalanced datasets using SMOTE or class_weight='balanced'

📈 Prediction Output Displays:

->Prediction result (Phishing or Legit)

->Confidence score (e.g., "Phishing - 91.4% confident")

->Explanation of suspicious content (keywords, mismatch headers)

🌐 Deployment

->Backend deployed on Render Web Service (gunicorn + Flask)

->Frontend deployed on Render Static Site (React build)

->Managed via a single render.yaml (monorepo structure)
